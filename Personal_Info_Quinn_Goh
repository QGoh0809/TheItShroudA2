<p>My student number is s3724287, and as of this year I begun my journey on a bachelor of IT at RMIT. I was born in Sydney Australia and unfortunately only speak English. Besides tertiary education, I work full time at a media production company at Fox Studios Australia- it encompasses a lot of my time which led to me only partially completing a bachelor of business at UTS.My ideal job would pivot on the combination of my degree in IT and my current occupation in Television Production. In order to do that I believe a job such as a Technical Lead at a digital or media production agency would make the most use of my skills and future skills. My work ethic/approach and behaviour in a group setting can best be illustrated through the results of some recent behavioural tests: </p>
