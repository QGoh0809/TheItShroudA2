<h3>Personal Information of team members from The IT Shroud</h3>

<h6>Matthew Andrews</h6>
I was born in Australia, where all of my English-speaking family have lived for many generations. I grew up mostly in Brisbane, Queensland. At the time I am writing this, I have minimal experience working in the IT field. I am passionate to learn how to make technology work, such as coding and programming so as to make hardware or software do what I want it to do. A simple example of this was my original project idea in Assignment 1, where I plan to program a raspberry pi to respond to BLE signals, to switch on and off lights or open and close doors. My hobbies range from creating electronic music, competing on road (push) bikes and modifying or restoring cars.


<h6>Jackson Shepherd<h6>
My name, as you probably are aware is Jackson Shepherd, I was born and raised in Australia and more specifially Western Sydney, NSW. I started my IT career around about 6-7 months ago when I gained an IT assistant role in a Club in the Western suburbs of Sydney. Before my employment, I had no prior IT experience apart from my enjoyment in playing video games since I was about 12 years old and mucking around with computer hardware with my Dad, whether it be pulling ram for later use or smashing hard drives when a computer or laptop died. I graduated year 12 and completed my HSC last year (2018) and since then have been working in the IT field, gaining as much experience as possible to set me up for my career. I enjoy playing video games, and tinkering with cars as well as learning new things, which is why i am excited to begin my career in the IT field as there is so much to learn about as because it is ever-changing.
