<h3>Personal Information of team members from The IT Shroud</h3>

<h6>Matthew Andrews</h6>
I was born in Australia, where all of my English-speaking family have lived for many generations. I grew up mostly in Brisbane, Queensland. At the time I am writing this, I have minimal experience working in the IT field. I am passionate to learn how to make technology work, such as coding and programming so as to make hardware or software do what I want it to do. A simple example of this was my original project idea in Assignment 1, where I plan to program a raspberry pi to respond to BLE signals, to switch on and off lights or open and close doors. My hobbies range from creating electronic music, competing on road (push) bikes and modifying or restoring cars.

<p>My student number is s3724287, and as of this year I begun my journey on a bachelor of IT at RMIT. I was born in Sydney Australia and unfortunately only speak English. Besides tertiary education, I work full time at a media production company at Fox Studios Australia- it encompasses a lot of my time which led to me only partially completing a bachelor of business at UTS.My ideal job would pivot on the combination of my degree in IT and my current occupation in Television Production. In order to do that I believe a job such as a Technical Lead at a digital or media production agency would make the most use of my skills and future skills. My work ethic/approach and behaviour in a group setting can best be illustrated through the results of some recent behavioural tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>Myers Brigg’s Results: Commander ENTJ-A / ENTJ-T</li>
<li>Learning Style Results:</li> 
<li>Auditory: 20%</li>
<li>Visual: 65%</li>
<li>Tactile: 15%</li>
<li>Creativity score: 81.75</li>
</ul>
